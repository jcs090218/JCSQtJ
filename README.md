# JCSQtJ

JCSQtJ is a rewrapper of Qt Jambi framework. Qt Jambi provide alot
of useful function that your build cross platform GUI software 
as fast as possible. The goal of this project is limit the pass
in params count, because Qt Jambi API have many detail. For instance,
callback, button trigger, etc. A lot of those params are following
Qt framework's standard, and I think those are acceptable for people
who developed/worked in Qt. For simplicity for rest of the people
I decide to have most of functionality and wrap it into one single
function call, so it will speed up alot faster during GUI base
software development. <br/><br/>
